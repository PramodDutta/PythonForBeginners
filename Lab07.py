#Python Operators

# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 3

print("a + b = ", a + b)  # addition
print("a - b = ", a - b)  # subtraction
print("a * b = ", a * b)  # multiplication
print("a / b = ", a / b)  # division
print("a % b = ", a % b)  # modulus
print("a // b = ", a // b)  # floor division
print("a ** b = ", a ** b)  # exponentiation

# Assignment Operators
c = 5
c += 3
print("c += 3, c = ", c)  # add AND assignment
c -= 2
print("c -= 2, c = ", c)  # subtract AND assignment
c *= 2
print("c *= 2, c = ", c)  # multiply AND assignment
c /= 2
print("c /= 2, c = ", c)  # divide AND assignment
c %= 3
print("c %= 3, c = ", c)  # modulus AND assignment
c //= 2
print("c //= 2, c = ", c)  # floor divide AND assignment
c **= 3
print("c **= 3, c = ", c)  # exponentiation AND assignment

# Relational/Comparison Operators
d = 8
e = 4

print("d == e: ", d == e)  # equal to
print("d != e: ", d != e)  # not equal to
print("d < e: ", d < e)  # less than
print("d > e: ", d > e)  # greater than
print("d <= e: ", d <= e)  # less than or equal to
print("d >= e: ", d >= e)  # greater than or equal to

# Logical Operators
f = True
g = False

print("f and g: ", f and g)  # logical AND
print("not f: ", not f)  # logical NOT
print("f or g: ", f or g)  # logical OR
